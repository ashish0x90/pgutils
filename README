1)Indexprofiling.py
  It can be run against a db instance to check what all indexes are present but are not getting used, 
  and where one should be creating indexes.
  Ofcourse, creating indexes is more of an art, one needs to know good detail of explain analyze and so on.
  But this is is good help at times.
  Run as : python Indexprofiling.py -U <username> -D <database_name> -H <hostname> -P <port(optional)>
           enter password for the user when prompted
           run python Indexprofiling.py -h for Help
